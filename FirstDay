My neighbour a young boy plays tennis.
That reminds me of the day's, i used to play..

You need to get your body and mind ready for the game even before you start
Whats more important is that you enjoy the game in the entire process.


One of the greatest in the game of tennis.
For me him playing with a single hand and not using the second hand for a backhand is most appealing

I love the classical style grasscourt tennis the most.
Even though the clay court is interesting but grass is classic.
